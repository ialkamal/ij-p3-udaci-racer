# UdaciRacer Simulation Game

## Summary

This is a game that races cars. To play the game, you select a player and track, the game begins and you accelerate your racer by clicking an acceleration button. As you accelerate so do the other players and the leaderboard live-updates as players change position on the track. The final view is a results page displaying the players' rankings.

The game has three main views:

1. The form to create a race

2. The race progress view (this includes the live-updating leaderboard and acceleration button)

3. The race results view

## Getting Started

Clone the project repository

`git clone https://github.com/ialkamal/ij-p3-udaci-racer.git`

In order to play this game, we need to run two things: the game engine API and the front end.

### Start the Server

Run the server, locate your operating system and run the associated command in your terminal at the root of the project.

| Your OS               | Command to start the API                                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mac                   | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-osx`   |
| Windows               | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server.exe`   |
| Linux (Ubuntu, etc..) | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-linux` |

Note that this process will use your terminal tab, so you will have to open a new tab and navigate back to the project root to start the front end.

#### WINDOWS USERS -- Setting Environment Variables

If you are using a windows machine:

1. `cd` into the root of the project containing data.json
2. Run the following command to add the environment variable:
   `set DATA_FILE=./data.json`

If you still run into issues running the API server on your machine, you can run this project in the Udacity classroom.

### Start the Frontend

Run your preference of `npm install && npm start` or `yarn && yarn start` at the root of this project. Then you should be able to access http://localhost:3000.
